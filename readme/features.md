# Top 10 Features 

1. To save the user time and to allow them to create an account without second guessing, I've added google login which makes life easier and makes the application look more professional. 
(See Appendix 1)

A user can create a shpping list under the shopping page. I've added a few features on this app:

2. When a user creates an item for the first time this item will be saved in their purchased items, this data is then used to workout their most purchased items and is displayed in order of favourites just above their shopping list for convenience. I've also used AJAX so that the page will not reload when items are being added from this list. Increment items and decrement items
(See Appendix 2)

3. Users are able to invite other members of Family Organiser to join their shopping list and become a shopping partner. This will allow all unterations of the shopping list to be done by both parties or as many shopping partners are they would like!

4. Insights for their shopping habbits has been added as a premium feature but even when the user is not a premium user this information is still being store if they happen to purchased their membership later down the line. Purchased history, monthly reports and top purchased items can be seen in both tables and bar/line graphs.

5. Status allow users to communicate with one another and users can leave feedback on thier posts such as likes and comments, likes and comments again use AJAX to prevent the page from reloading. I've also added an animation when the like button is pressed to give the user a little enjoyment when using the application.

6. I've added messaging on this application because being able to communicate with your friends and family is one of the goals of this application. Users can create new conversation with their friends and also continue from previously created conversations.
