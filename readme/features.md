# Top 10 Features 

These are not in any particular order.

1. To save the user time and to allow them to create an account without second-guessing, I've added google login which makes life easier and makes the application look more professional. 

(See Appendix 1)

A user can create a shopping list under the shopping page. I've added a few features on this app:

2. When a user creates an item for the first time this item will be saved in their purchased items, this data is then used to work out their most purchased items and is displayed in order of favourites just above their shopping list for convenience. I've also used AJAX so that the page will not reload when items are being added from this list. Increment items and decrement items

(See Appendix 2)

3. Users are able to invite other members of Family Organiser to join their shopping list and become a shopping partner. This will allow all unterations of the shopping list to be done by both parties or as many shopping partners are they would like!

(See Appendix 3)

4. Insights for their shopping habits has been added as a premium feature but even when the user is not a premium user this information is still being store if they happen to purchase their membership later down the line. Purchased history, monthly reports and top purchased items can be seen in both tables and bar/line graphs.

(See Appendix 4)

5. Status allows users to communicate with one another and users can leave feedback on their posts such as likes and comments, likes and comments again use AJAX to prevent the page from reloading. I've also added an animation when the like button is pressed to give the user a little enjoyment when using the application.

(See Appendix 5)

6. I've added messaging on this application because being able to communicate with your friends and family is one of the goals of this application. Users can create a new conversation with their friends and also continue from previously created conversations.

(See Appendix 6)

(Appendix 6)

![Messages](https://github.com/Fordalex/family_organiser/blob/master/readme/images/messaging.JPG "Messages")

7. Notifications will be added on the user's profile page for messages, friend requests, event requests, partner requests and someone either liking or commenting on their status. I've also added a notification page which will take the user to the post or user profile when selected.

(See Appendix 7)

8. Users can create an event and invite their friends and family to join them. Only the creator of the event sent invitations.

(See Appendix 8)

9. On the event invitation I've added particles to give a confetti effect to again try and make the app more enjoyable for the user.

(See Appendix 9)

10. Finally I've linked the app up with google calendar to make sure that the user will never forget, google calendar will be able to send a notification to the user's phone when set up with google calendar. I've made it easy as the user just pressing one button when on their event. There is one bug left with this feature! The time that the event is booked for it gets saved on the calendar one hour late...
